## Get full name

1. Can you write a function called `getFullName` which takes 3 parameters:

- first name (compulsory)
- middle name (optional)
- last name (compulsory)

How do you do an optional parameter in TS? Where does this optional parameter have to be? (ref:[https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/typescript-optional-parameters/])

### Extensions

1. Create a version of getFullName that is passed a single object? What did you notice about this version? Did you prefer it?
